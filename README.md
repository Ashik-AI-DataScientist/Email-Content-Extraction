Email Content Extraction Framework
Welcome to the Email Content Extraction Framework repository! This project focuses on leveraging advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract and summarize meaningful insights from unstructured email datasets. It aims to streamline data processing and enhance decision-making by automating the summarization process.

Project Overview
Managing vast amounts of email data manually is challenging, especially when actionable insights are buried in unstructured formats. This project offers:

An automated approach to summarize email content efficiently.
High-quality summarization leveraging transformer-based models like T5 and BART.
Flexible handling of both labeled and unlabeled datasets.
Scalable data processing pipelines for large datasets.
Key Features
Automated Summarization: Uses transformer models for concise and accurate email summaries.
Dataset Handling:
Supervised Learning: Fine-tunes models with manually labeled summaries.
Unsupervised Learning: Applies clustering and similarity-based techniques for unlabeled datasets.
Scalability: Handles large datasets using PySpark and parallel processing.
Data Visualization: Provides dashboards using Tableau to highlight trends and insights.
GDPR Compliance: Ensures secure handling of sensitive email content.
Technologies and Tools
Programming Languages: Python
Frameworks and Libraries: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
Data Processing: PySpark, SQL
Visualization: Tableau
Environment: Google Colab, Jupyter Notebooks
Installation Guide
Step 1: Clone the Repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/email-content-extraction.git
cd email-content-extraction
Step 2: Install Dependencies
Use the provided requirements.txt file to install necessary Python packages:

bash

Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 3: Prepare Your Dataset
Place your dataset in the data/ directory.
Use the preprocessing.py script to clean and preprocess the data:
bash
Copy
Edit
python preprocessing.py --input data/raw_emails.csv --output data/processed_emails.csv
Usage Guide
Training the Model
Train the summarization model using your processed dataset:

bash
Copy
Edit
python train.py --model T5 --data data/processed_emails.csv
Generating Summaries
Use the trained model to summarize new email content:

bash
Copy
Edit
python predict.py --input data/new_emails.csv --output results/summaries.csv
Visualization
Visualize the results with Tableau templates provided in the visualization/ folder.

Results
Efficiency: Improved data processing time by 35%.
Accuracy: Achieved a ROUGE score of 46.3 for summarization quality.
Scalability: Successfully processed datasets with over 1 million email records.
Future Scope
Real-time integration with cloud-based email servers.
Support for multilingual email datasets.
Enhanced fine-tuning for industry-specific use cases.
