      "It’s the start of a brand-new year, which gives us a great opportunity to kick-off a brand-new Race for Q1 2023. ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ Introducing the EMEA North Q1 2023 Partner Race! , It’s the start of a brand-new year, which gives us a great opportunity to kick-off a brand-new Race for Q1 2023. The SAP EMEA North Q1 Race for 2023 Pipeline Creation is open to you, our Sell Partners, and is based on SAP cloud solution deals registered on the SAP Partner Portal. To win, you will need to register at least 10 SAP Cloud solution deals with five different end-customers on the SAP Partner Portal during the incentive timeframe (January 1st to March 31st 2023). Each deal registered needs to have a minimum annual contract value (ACV) of €5,000. The winning partner in each Market Unit will enjoy a meal  at a restaurant of their choice, worth up to €150 per guest (with a maximum number of 20 guests per winning partner). The top three partners in each Market Unit will also receive a winner’s certificate. Here’s a breakdown of all you need to know (a complete set of Terms & Conditions and calculations can be found here): The Q1 2023 Partner Incentive applies to deals registered on the SAP Partner Portal by Resell Partners on cloud solutions of the SAP Digital Enterprise Platform and the SAP applications solution portfolio, excluding SAP Business One and third party solutions The winning partner per Market Unit will receive an incentive reward for accumulating the highest number of Challenge Credits by the end of the validity period (31st March 2023) To win, partners need to register at least 10 (ten) deals and 5 (five) different end-customers on the SAP Partner Portal during the incentive validity period (January 1st to March 31st 2023) Each deal registered needs to have a minimum annual contract value (ACV) of €5,000 Deals registered need to have a closing date of before September 30th, 2023 Deals have to be registered from January 11st to March 31st, 2023 In the event of a tie on the number of opportunities registered by two partners in a Market Unit, the highest total registered revenue (ACV) will determine the winner.

      "Join Us Wednesday, January 25 1:00pm ET (UTC-5) , Join Us Wednesday Jan 25 @ 1:00pm Eastern (UTC-5) / 12:00pm Central / 10:00am Pacific for our next State of .NET - State of AI and Machine Learning webinar (approximately 75 mins). Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence is everywhere these days. While some developers are still wondering how their app could benefit from these technologies, it is more accurate to wonder which apps can't be made better with these types of features. This State of .NET event will take a look at what the latest and the greatest in Machine Learning is and how .NET developers can easily take advantage of it, with becoming mathematical geniuses or data scientists. Markus will take a look at the overall AI landscape and provide a high-level overview of the different types of AI (such as “shallow learning”, “deep learning”, and “General Articicial Intelligence” a.k.a. “GAI”) and how t apply to software capabilities and their impact. In addition to an introduction to these concepts, this event will focus a lot on concretely using various concepts in today's software development as it relates to all software developers (with the need to focus entirely on AI development, or being a data scientist).  to Register for FREE!

      "With every passing year, cyberattacks continue to grow in scale and sophistication. Just one cyberattack holds the potential to cripple an entire enterprise and stop its IT operations in its tracks. Despite this growing threat, organizations can take an important step to drastically reduce the risk of attack: implementing hardware-based security solutions that go below the OS and protect PCs at the BIOS and system memory levels. In an independently conducted and Intel-sponsored study titled “Security Innovation: Secure Systems Start with Foundational Hardware ,” the Ponemon Institute spoke with 1,406 IT decision makers around the globe to gather their insights on their cybersecurity priorities. The message was clear: Hardware-based security solutions are quickly becoming a foundational element of enterprise security strategies. * While 36% of those surveyed said they’ve already adopted hardware-based security solutions, an additional 47% said that t to implement such technologies in either the next six months (24%) or 12 months (23%). * Perhaps more telling were the additional responses from the respondents who have already implemented hardware-based solutions, with 85% identifying this technology as a high or very high priority. * Furthermore, 64% said that hardware was a part of their organization’s endpoint security strategy. In other words, those who were quick to implement hardware-based protective measures do not view this as a gimmick, but rather as an essential innovation that provides real value to their bottom line. But these survey insights are just scratching the surface of the Ponemon Institute’s report.
